# Device test backlog

Free-account signing allows **10 App IDs per 7 days**, so installs are a
budgeted resource. Anything that can be verified in CI must be, and device
installs are batched.

**The rule:** if it needs the GPU, the Pencil, or the display, it goes on this
list. Everything else gets a unit test and never touches the iPad.

## Pending — needs a Pencil Pro

Accumulated since the last install. One install should clear all of these.

| # | What | How | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pressure → width | Draw pressing hard, then light | Line visibly thickens and thins |
| 2 | `pressure` readout | Watch HUD while pressing | 0.000 → ~1.000 |
| 3 | `tilt` readout | Hold upright, then angle it | ~90° upright, falls as you tilt |
| 4 | `azimuth` readout | Swing the pencil around a fixed point | Sweeps 0–360° |
| 5 | `roll` readout | Twist the barrel | **A number**, not `—`, and it changes |
| 6 | `hover` readout | Hold just above the glass | A number appears, `—` when far |
| 7 | `squeeze` counter | Squeeze the barrel | Increments |
| 8 | `dbl-tap` counter | Double-tap the barrel | Increments |
| 9 | `peak/fr` | Draw a fast stroke | Climbs toward ~4 |

## Pending — drawing quality (finger is fine)

Never checked on device since the resampling fix landed. Cheap to fold into
any install.

| # | What | How | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | Curve smoothness | Fast loops and spirals | No faceting, no visible rectangles |
| 11 | Self-crossing | Cross a stroke over itself | Crossing is **not** darker than the rest |
| 13 | Prediction artefacts | Sharp direction reversals at speed | No stray spur left behind at the turn |

## Pending — UI regressions to confirm

| # | What | How | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 37 | Panel scroll survives a rebuild | Scroll the layer list down, pick a blend mode | The **layer list** stays where it was |
| 38 | Blend list scroll survives a rebuild | Scroll the 26-mode list down, pick a mode | The **mode list** stays where it was |

## Known and deliberate

Not bugs; do not report these until the milestone that addresses them.

- **Square stroke ends.** Round caps arrive with dab stamping at M3.
- **No texture.** There is no brush engine yet — strokes are smooth geometry.
- **Only black.** There is no colour picker yet. It arrives with the brush
  engine at M3, and until then it limits what any blend-mode test can show.
- **Canvas is screen-sized.** Pan, zoom and a canvas larger than the screen
  come with the per-tile render restructure — see the re-scoped item in
  ROADMAP.md.

Bugs found on device, all invisible to CI because
they lived in the Swift shell rather than the engine:

1. **Strokes were never bracketed.** `beginStroke` was never called, so no
   stroke entered the undo history at all. Undo was unwinding earlier `clear`
   operations, which looked like random cells reverting.
2. **Gestures committed phantom strokes.** A two-finger tap still delivers
   touches to the view, so the tap started a stroke, which committed an undo
   action and cleared the redo stack. Undo appeared to work once and then
   stop; redo never worked.
3. **The layers panel collapsed to its header.** A scroll view has no
   intrinsic content size, so the panel had an upper bound and nothing pushing
   against it. Rows laid out into zero height.
4. **The layer detail section overlapped itself.** Buttons without explicit
   heights let UIStackView compress them, and 26 inline blend modes made the
   section taller than the screen. Delete was unreachable.
5. **The panel rebuilt itself mid-drag.** Every property change fired
   `onLayersChanged`, which destroyed the very slider the user was dragging.
   Opacity moved one step and then stopped.
6. **Rebuilding lost scroll position.** Restoring an offset from the parent
   view reads a `contentSize` of zero: Auto Layout computes it during the
   scroll view's *own* layout pass, which runs afterwards. The panel survived
   this by accident — it is laid out repeatedly, so its retry eventually
   landed — while a row inside a stack view got one pass and no second chance.
   Both now restore from inside the scroll view.

The engine was correct throughout. Every one of these lived in how the shell
drove it — layout and view lifecycle, not logic — which is the argument for
pushing more behind the C ABI where CI can reach it. Note the shape they share:
none are arithmetic, all are UIKit rebuilding or sizing something at the wrong
moment.
